Scenario 1: Assuming that the SS does not reach the shoreline (affects deep water only). 
Deep water: WL + Actual Depth (Actual Depth = depth at deep waters = constant) 
At the breakwater: Actual depth (Actual depth = Depth at the breakwater = constant) - Assessment of refraction and hbr.
Behind the breakwater: Actual depth (Actual depth = Average profile depth) - Assessment of diffraction and hbr.
This code is simply used for visual and practice purposes.
